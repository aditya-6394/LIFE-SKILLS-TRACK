### What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

- Unwanted sexual advances, comments, or requests for sexual favors.
- Displaying sexually explicit or offensive materials.
- Making offensive or sexually suggestive jokes or comments.

### What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

- Assess the Situation: Evaluate the severity and context of the behavior. Is it a one-time occurrence, or is it a recurring problem? Determine if immediate action is required.
- Intervene Appropriately: If it's safe to do so and within my capacity, I would consider intervening by politely but firmly addressing the behavior. For example, I might say, "That comment is inappropriate, please stop."
