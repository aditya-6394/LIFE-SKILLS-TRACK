### **Question 1:** Which point(s) were new to you?

The following points were new to me:
- The way you ask a question determines whether it will be answered or not. You need to make it very easy for the person to answer your question.
- Messages like "the database is not connecting, need your help" or "the build is not working, can you help me out" will not get you the answers you are looking for.
- It's essential to explain the problem clearly and mention the solutions you've tried to fix the problem.

### **Question 2:** Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

I need to improve on asking questions effectively and planning before implementing. To make progress in this area, I plan to:

- Craft clear and concise questions that are easy for others to understand and answer.
- Before implementing any solution, create a detailed plan that outlines the steps, potential challenges, and possible solutions.
- Practice active listening to better understand others' perspectives and feedback, which can inform my planning and question-asking.
