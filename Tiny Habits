### **Question 1:** In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most intriguing concept in the video was BJ Fogg's idea of starting with tiny habits instead of attempting radical changes. He emphasizes that by addressing the cue, routine, or reward in a small way, we can kickstart successful habit formation. For instance, to establish the habit of flossing, he suggests beginning with just one tooth, making the new behavior easy to maintain and eventually develop into a full habit.

### **Question 2:** How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?

To make forming new habits easier, you can follow BJ Fogg's "Tiny Habits Method," which consists of B = MAP:

- **M (Motivation):** Make the behavior incredibly small, requiring minimal motivation.
- **A (Action):** Use an action prompt, like a trigger or completion of one behavior to initiate the new habit.
- **P (Prompt):** Celebrate after a tiny win to create a sense of accomplishment, boosting motivation and confidence. This feeling is called "shine."

This method simplifies habit formation and can be highly effective.

### **Question 3:** Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

Celebrating after each successful habit completion, or "shining," is essential because it reinforces a sense of accomplishment, boosts motivation, and builds confidence. Celebrations make the behavior more likely to become a habit by creating a positive association with it.

### **Question 4:** In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most fascinating idea from the video was the concept from "Atomic Habits" by James Clear, emphasizing the effectiveness of small changes and their potential for significant results. Prioritizing systems over goals and ensuring that small changes are easy and satisfying can lead to meaningful improvements, a concept that has positively impacted James' own life.

### **Question 5:** What is the book's perspective about Identity?

The book "Atomic Habits" by James Clear emphasizes the importance of identity in habit formation. It suggests that true behavior change is not only about what you do but also about who you become. Clear argues that by focusing on your identity and viewing yourself as the type of person who engages in a particular behavior, you can make habit changes more sustainable. In essence, it's about aligning your habits with your self-perception and becoming the person you aspire to be.

### **Question 6:** Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

The book "Atomic Habits" recommends making a habit easier to do by reducing the friction associated with it. This involves simplifying the task, creating an obvious and attractive environment for the habit, and breaking it down into smaller, manageable steps. Making the habit convenient and appealing increases the likelihood of consistent execution.

### **Question 7:** Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

"Atomic Habits" suggests making a habit harder to do by increasing the friction around it. This can be achieved by creating obstacles, adding steps, or making the habit less appealing. By making the habit less convenient or attractive, you reduce the likelihood of its execution.

### **Question 8:** Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

One habit I'd like to do more of is reading regularly. To make it more attractive and easy, I can:

- **Cue (Obvious):** Place a book on my bedside table or carry one in my bag, so it's a visible reminder.

- **Attractive:** Choose books on topics I'm passionate about or genres I enjoy, making the habit more appealing.

- **Easy:** Set a specific time for reading, like before bedtime or during breaks, creating a routine that simplifies the process.

- **Satisfying:** Keep a reading journal to track my progress and jot down insights, making the habit more rewarding and motivating.

### **Question 9:** Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

I'd like to reduce my time spent on social media. To make it less attractive and harder, I can:

- **Invisible Cue:** Remove social media apps from my phone's home screen to reduce the visibility and temptation.

- **Unattractive Process:** Set app time limits or use website blockers to make accessing social media less appealing.

- **Hard:** Place my phone in another room or deactivate notifications to create physical and mental barriers to usage.

- **Unsatisfying Response:** Reflect on the time wasted on social media and the missed opportunities for more fulfilling activities to reduce the reward associated with it.
