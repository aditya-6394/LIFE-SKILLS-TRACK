## 1. How to Learn Faster with the Feynman Technique:

### Feynman Technique

The **Feynman Technique** is a method for accelerated learning and understanding complex topics. This technique, developed by physicist Richard Feynman, consists of four simple steps:

- **Choose a Topic**: Select the subject or concept you want to learn.

- **Teach It to a Child (or Someone Unfamiliar)**:

  - Explain the topic as if you were teaching it to a child or someone with no prior knowledge.

- **Identify Knowledge Gaps**:

  - During the explanation, take note of areas where you struggle to clarify the topic.

- **Review and Simplify**:
  - Return to your study materials to review the challenging parts.

## 2. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

Interesting idea from the video is that practicing and repeating what we learn is important for gaining mastery over a subject. Barbara Oakley emphasizes that combining understanding with practice and repetition is key to truly retaining information and being able to apply it effectively.

## Question 3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

Active thinking involves focused and intentional problem-solving or decision-making, while diffused thinking is a relaxed, background mental state that encourages creativity and connections between ideas.
Active thinking is like a spotlight, while diffused thinking is like a floodlight for your mind.

## Question 4. According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?

- Research: Gather initial information about the topic.
- Organize: Create an outline or structure for understanding.
- Study: Dive into detailed resources and take notes.
- Practice: Apply what you've learned through exercises or examples.
- Review: Regularly revisit and reinforce your understanding.
- Engage: Discuss and exchange ideas with others for deeper insights.

## Question 5. What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

I would prefer thinking actively and have a clear mindset.
